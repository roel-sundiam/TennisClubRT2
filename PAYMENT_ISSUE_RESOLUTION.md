# Tennis Club Payment Issue Resolution & Multi-Hour Reservation Enhancement

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: User reserved court 6AM-8AM for â‚±180 but payment was split incorrectly, showing â‚±90 paid for 6AM-7AM and â‚±90 pending for 7AM-8AM.

**Root Cause**: Tennis Club RT2 system only supported single-hour reservations, creating separate reservation records for multi-hour bookings, leading to payment allocation confusion.

## âœ… Immediate Resolution

### Payment Issue Fixed
- **Before**: â‚±180 payment allocated only to 6AM-7AM slot, â‚±90 pending for 7AM-8AM
- **After**: â‚±180 payment properly split into â‚±90 for each hour slot
- **Result**: No pending payments, both time slots fully paid

### Database Changes Made
1. Updated payment reference `TC-1757204057558-AQ5NUQ` to â‚±90 for 6AM-7AM
2. Created payment reference `TC-1757204057558-AQ5NUQ-2ND` for â‚±90 for 7AM-8AM  
3. Updated payment descriptions to clarify 2-hour booking context
4. Set both reservation payment statuses to 'paid'

## ðŸš€ Long-Term Enhancement: Multi-Hour Reservation System

### Database Schema Updates

#### Reservation Model Enhanced
```typescript
// New fields added to support multi-hour reservations
duration: {
  type: Number,
  min: 1, max: 4,
  default: 1,
  required: true
},
endTimeSlot: {
  type: Number,
  min: 6, max: 23,
  index: true
},
isMultiHour: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false,
  index: true
}
```

#### TypeScript Interfaces Updated
- `CreateReservationRequest` now accepts `duration?: number`
- `CourtReservation` includes multi-hour fields
- Backward compatible with existing single-hour reservations

### Backend Logic Enhancements

#### 1. Intelligent Availability Checking
```typescript
// New method: isSlotRangeAvailable()
// Checks for conflicts across multiple time slots
// Prevents overlapping reservations (e.g., 2PM-4PM vs 3PM-5PM)
```

#### 2. Duration-Based Fee Calculation
```typescript
// Pre-save middleware calculates fees per hour
// Handles mixed peak/off-peak pricing
// Example: 6PM-9PM = â‚±100 (peak) + â‚±90 (off-peak) + â‚±100 (peak)
```

#### 3. Automatic Field Population
- `endTimeSlot = timeSlot + duration`
- `isMultiHour = duration > 1`
- Validation ensures bookings don't extend past court hours (10 PM)

### API Enhancements

#### Reservation Creation
```http
POST /api/reservations
{
  "date": "2025-09-10",
  "timeSlot": 15,
  "duration": 2,  // NEW: 2 hours (3PM-5PM)
  "players": ["Player 1", "Player 2"]
}
```

#### Response includes multi-hour information
```json
{
  "timeSlot": 15,
  "endTimeSlot": 17,
  "duration": 2,
  "isMultiHour": true,
  "timeSlotDisplay": "15:00 - 17:00",
  "totalFee": 180
}
```

### Key Benefits

#### For Users
- âœ… Single reservation for multi-hour sessions
- âœ… Clear time range display (6AM-8AM instead of separate slots)  
- âœ… One payment for entire session
- âœ… Accurate fee calculation across peak/off-peak hours
- âœ… Better user experience and less confusion

#### For System
- âœ… Reduced database records (1 instead of N for N-hour booking)
- âœ… Cleaner payment tracking
- âœ… Better conflict detection
- âœ… More accurate availability checking
- âœ… Easier reporting and analytics

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-hour reservations continue to work unchanged
- `duration` defaults to 1 if not specified
- `isSlotAvailable()` method maintained for legacy support
- Database migration not required (new fields have defaults)

### Validation Rules
- Duration: 1-4 hours maximum
- Time slots: 5 AM - 10 PM court hours
- End time validation: `endTimeSlot â‰¤ 23`
- Conflict detection across entire duration range

### Pricing Logic
```typescript
// Example: 6PM-9PM booking (3 hours)
// 6PM (peak): â‚±100
// 7PM (off-peak): â‚±90  
// 8PM (peak): â‚±100
// Total: â‚±290
```
