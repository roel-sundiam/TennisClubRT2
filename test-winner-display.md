## Visual Features

### Winner Indicators
1. **Status Badge**: Shows "COMPLETED" with green checkmark icon
2. **Match Result Box**: Prominent display with:
   - Trophy icon and "Match Result" header
   - Large score display (e.g., "6-4, 6-2") 
   - "Team X Wins!" announcement with trophy emoji
3. **Winning Team Highlight**: 
   - Green gradient background
   - Thicker green border
   - Slight scale-up (1.02x)

### Match Status Colors
- **Scheduled**: Gray (default state)
- **In Progress**: Yellow/amber (active matches)
- **Completed**: Green (finished matches)

## Data Requirements
The feature expects match objects to have:
- `match.status` - 'scheduled', 'in_progress', or 'completed'
- `match.score` - Match score string (e.g., "6-4, 6-2")
- `match.winningTeam` - 1 or 2 (which team won)

## Benefits
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Completed matches stand out clearly
- **Immediate Winner Recognition**: Users can quickly see match results
- **Professional Look**: Matches the tennis club's premium design system
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Accessible**: Uses proper color contrast and icons

## Usage
When admins record match results in the backend:
1. Set `match.status = 'completed'`
2. Set `match.score = '6-4, 6-2'` (or actual score)
3. Set `match.winningTeam = 1` or `2`

The UI will automatically display the winner indicators and highlight the winning team.
